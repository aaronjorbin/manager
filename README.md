This is inspired by <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/">"How to Rands"</a> and is my own personal introduction to myself and my leadership style. It's mostly for people reporting to me, but it's probably useful for anyone interacting with me.

Let me start by saying you should send me an invite for a 1-on-1.  You should own this invite, I shouldn't be able to edit it or move it without your permission.  Why? Because this meeting is about you.  It's our chance to connect to discuss what's on your mind and how I can help you achieve your goals.

Speaking of goals, we should work on setting them for you. I am a believer that long-term goal setting is a hard problem, so we should instead set shorter term goals. I think quarterly is good. Additionally, these goals should be challenging enough that you are unlikely to hit 100% of them. If you hit 100% of your goals, that means you didn't push yourself hard enough. Not hitting 100% of your goals is normal and is not a strike against you. Not hitting 75% of your goals is more a problem and one that we will talk about.

You can slack me whenever you need. If it's urgent, push through do not disturb. What's the definition of urgent? It's your decision. I am here to help you. If I can reply, I will. If not, I'll reply as soon as I can.

Vacation is sacred. You should take it. You should not think about work during it. Over-communicate with me and anyone you work directly with leading up to it though. I'll try to ensure deadlines and deployments are set in a way that nothing catches on fire.

I trust you to communicate and share with me anything I should know. CC me on emails you think I should see. If you need to chat, ping me. I want to be able to celebrate your work when you do great things.  I also want to be able to support you when things aren't going great. Communication is the base for this.

I like sharing in process thoughts or what I often refer to as "half-baked ideas".  These should be taken as pure ideas, not as must-dos or will-happens in any way.  I'll try to be clear when this is the case, but feel free to ask questions.

You should also know that I am bad at some things. I'm sorry about this in advance.
 - I am not a morning person and generally am not at my peak until I've been going for a few hours</li>
 - I get annoyed when people are late for meetings. I am also often late for meetings myself. Yes, I am annoyed with myself when that happens. </li>
 - I say fuck a lot. If you are bothered by it, I need you to say something to me so that I can try to censor my language.
 - I tend to be a jokester and a bit of a friendly troll, especially when I am in a good mood. If you are bothered by jokes, please let me know.</li>
 - I can be forgetful at times. I try to write things down, but if it seems like I forgot to do something please feel free to message me about it.

Outside of work, I like art and beverages a lot. Always happy to discuss coffee, beer, cocktails, art, and art museums.
